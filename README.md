What Is AWT?
<br>
<br>
AWT stands for “Abstract Window Toolkit”. It is an API used to develop window-based applications in Java. This abstract window toolkit comprises various components like the classes, methods, label, text field, button, etc which are used for designing and managing GUI.

What Is Swing?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Swing is a graphical user interface (GUI) and a part of Oracle’s Java Foundation Classes that are used to design different applications. Swing was developed to provide a more advanced set of GUI components like JTextField, JCheckbox, JMenu, etc.

Swing is a more-or-less pure-Java GUI. It uses AWT to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of buttons, labels, text, checkboxes, etc., into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks, key entries, etc., deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it.
